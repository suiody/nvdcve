The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and submitting malicious input to the load command within the VPN subsystem. The attacker must be authenticated to access the affected CLI parameter. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute commands with root privileges. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vEdge 100 Series Routers, vEdge 1000 Series Routers, vEdge 2000 Series Routers, vEdge 5000 Series Routers, vEdge Cloud Router Platform, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software.
